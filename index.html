        <h1>Caesar Cipher!</h1>
        <p>The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It's a type of
            substitution
            cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For
            example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after
            Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his generals.</p>
